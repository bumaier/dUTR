# dUTR
This project aims to describe the global changes in 3'UTRs upon CPSF6kd in U-2 OS cells

This should fix some issues in exon transformation on + strand genes:
  - the last exon is not transformed for some unknown reasons
  - some genes lack any transformed exons (likeley regarding NR_ isoforms with more than one exon)
